# DOD-DOTS
This repo is a compilation of material for data-oriented design and Unity DOTS.

DOTS is the Data-Oriented Technology Stack for the Unity game engine. DOTS builds on a component-based storage model using the Arrays of Structures pattern, in order to provide massive performance gains when compared to an object-oriented storage model.

Mike Acton has several inspirational and relevant talks on data-oriented design. There will be some overlap between the videos listed, but each contains unique information.

For an introduction to data-oriented design I recommend first watching 2 talks by Mike Acton:
CppCon 2014: Mike Acton "Data-Oriented Design and C++"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc
The slides are found here: 
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014/raw/master/Presentations/Data-Oriented%20Design%20and%20C%2B%2B/Data-Oriented%20Design%20and%20C%2B%2B%20-%20Mike%20Acton%20-%20CppCon%202014.pptx

I suggest following that up with "Solving the Right Problems for Engine Programmers - Mike Actonâ€Œ (TGC 2017)"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B00hV3wmMY

At this point it probably makes sense to get a quick overview of how Unity works, by reading some of the manual. I would probably start here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html , and follow that up with https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest/.

Then I would recommend watching this talk about DOTS and the intent behind some of the features: "Building a Data-Oriented Future - Mike Acton"
